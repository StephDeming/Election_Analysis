## Project Overview
Completing the election audit of a Colorado congressional election by:

- Calculating total number of votes cast
- Formulating a complete list of candidates who received votes.
- Calculating the total number of votes each candidate received
- Calculating the percentage of votes each candidate won
- Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote

## Resources
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python, (VSC)Visual Studio Code

## Summary 
The analysis of the material provided of the Colorado Congressional election shows that:

- Diana DeGette won with 73.8% (272,892) of the votes.
- Charles Casper Stockham was runner-up with 23.0% (85,212) of the votes.
- Raymon Anthony Doane was third with 3.1% (11,606) of the votes. 

## Challenge Overview

Overall I found Python and VSC much more pleasant and straightforward than VBA. I ran into a few issues initially with finding correct file paths as I was using OneDrive, not local paths.
