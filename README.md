## Election-Audit Summary:

With this versatile script there are many ways where it can be formatted to run with any election data. 
With a quick look at the source data the candidatesand sources of the vores(in this case counties) can be ordered into a format(dictionary) with which tests can be run. In the first image the candidate and county can easily be found by changing the row search parameters. 

In the second image the counties in this data set are searched through and updated. This would be easy to do with any voting data, from small local elections to nationwide. It's a matter of plugging it in and going, the append funstion will add the missing data to your list.
